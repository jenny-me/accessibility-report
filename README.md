# Accessibility Report

This report was created to display findings from an automated and manual accessibility review. 

The report was built using Vue.js v2 and had pulled all of the WCAG and report content from a CMS. The report is getting updated so that it can stand alone without the CMS.

**Status**: In progress


## Roadmap

[] Move color contrast check into main app
[] Reduce hard-coded information pulling it out into JSON files
[] Update report to Vue 3
[] Design updates (especially on dark mode)
[] Add severity information to issues
[] Add ability to add detailed notes (for fix instructions, info on where to find issue or how to replicate, etc)
